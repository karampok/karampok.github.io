      <description>&lt;p&gt;Learning golang can be very distractfull !!!!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I have really enjoyed learning go, but i must admit that i have hard time to
keep myself on track. There are too many interesting  projects written on go and
everytime instead of going deeper to go, I go deeper to the projects.
&lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com/spf13/hugo&#34;&gt;Hugo&lt;/a&gt; was one of that projects that made
extremely easy to build my web page and therefore I spent some (thankfully not
a lot) time to fix this web site. On top that, there are always cool people to tip
how to host and improve the site in general.&lt;/p&gt;
