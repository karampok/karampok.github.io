Learning golang can be very distractfull!

I have really enjoyed learning go, but i must admit that i have hard time to
keep myself on track. There are too many interesting  projects written on go and
everytime instead of going deeper to go, I go deeper to the projects.
[Hugo](https://github.com/spf13/hugo) was one of that projects that made
extremely easy to build my web page and therefore I spent some (thankfully not
a lot) time to fix this web site. On top that, there are always cool people to tip
how to host and improve the site in general.
