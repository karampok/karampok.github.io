I am a Full-Stack Engineer, who enjoys facing new challenges and working on
solutions that guarantee a stable and efficient environment. I am an open
source and Linux hands-on enthusiast, but most importantly a computer engineer
with a wide range of skills.

I always try to stay open to new concepts, get updated with new technologies
and produce original ideas. I try to adapt myself in a constantly changing
environment, while my strong security-oriented background and my passion for
detail helps me to stay focused and develop myself not only independently but
also as part of a team.
